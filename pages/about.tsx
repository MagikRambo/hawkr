                    <p className="pb-4">My name is Mike Marambio, and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Utah, set to graduate in the spring of 2023. As an aspiring software engineer, I am passionate about building scalable and efficient systems, particularly in the areas of Microservices, Distributed Systems, and Containerization.</p>
                    
                    <p className="pb-4"> In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also an undergraduate researcher at the Visual Perception and Spatial Cognition Lab, where I focus on exploring the potential of Mixed Reality. Furthermore, I am honored to serve as Vice President of The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), a role that has allowed me to connect with fellow students and professionals in the engineering field while promoting diversity and inclusion. </p>
                    
                    <p className="pb-4">My interest in software development has also led me to intern at Microsoft twice. During my first internship, I developed an admin UI and later pivoted the project towards a Full-Stack direction. In my second internship, I created a developer tool to simplify containerization and improve the developer life cycle.</p>
                    
                    <p className="pb-4">When I'm not immersed in coding, I enjoy training, learning new hobbies, and spending quality time with family and friends. After graduation, I plan to continue developing my current project and integrate additional features to benefit small local vendors. I am confident that my skills and experiences will enable me to make a meaningful impact in the software engineering industry.</p>
