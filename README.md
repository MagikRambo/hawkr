# Hawkr

A Hawker is "defined as a person who travels around selling goods, typically advertising them by shouting" Our application aims to connect street entertainers, vendors and popup food sellers with their clients in a seamless easy to use web app.

# Complete Project Description (abstract)

In the world of small mobile businesses location is critical, but often left unknown to the clients. Pop-up shops, and food trucks are often difficult to track down since they often move from location to location, thus making it difficult for customers to find where their favorite businesses are. Tourists, visitors, and those looking to try something new find locating mobile businesses without knowing of them first is virtually impossible. The solution to this is Hawkr. The Hawkr app will serve all small mobile vendors connecting them with customers who are interested in supporting them. This means that everyone in the entire community can locate and identify new and existing businesses in the vicinity through the use of Hawkrâ€™s mapping. To reach the widest audience possible, the first implementation of this project will be focused on developing a web-app, and if time allows we will extend it to a dedicated mobile application. Through the use of this web-app, youâ€™ll find your favorite mobile businesses and identify new ones!
